<h3>
 
My Background
</h3>
<p>
 
I taught myself how to use code to make mods for minecraft, as it is one of my favorite games. I come from right here in Shelby, NC. I 
like playing Minecraft and other adjacent video games.
</p>
<h3>
 
My Future
</h3>
<p>
 
I would like to make more mods for games. I'd like to live in Shelby, NC. And I'm not sure what I want to do for work in the future.
